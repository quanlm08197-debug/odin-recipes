        <h2>Steps to Make Pho</h2>
        <ol>            
            <li>
                <strong>Parboil and Clean Bones (Crucial Step):</strong>
                Place the beef bones in a large pot and cover with water.
                Bring to a boil for 10 minutes to release impurities.
                Drain, discard the water, and wash the bones thoroughly under cold water to remove any debris. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Char the Aromatics:</strong>
                Char the onions and ginger directly over an open gas flame or under a broiler until blackened in spots (about 5-10 minutes). 
                Rinse off the burnt skin and trim off any overly charred parts. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Simmer the Broth:</strong>
                Return the cleaned bones and brisket to a clean, large pot (12-16 quarts) and add 5-6 quarts of fresh water. 
                Add the charred onions, ginger, and salt. 
                Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce heat to a low simmer. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Toast Spices:</strong>
                Toast the star anise, cinnamon stick, cloves, and coriander seeds in a dry pan over medium heat for 2-3 minutes until fragrant. 
                Place them in a spice bag or tea infuser. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Simmer and Strain:</strong>
                Add the spice bag to the pot. 
                Simmer for 3–6 hours, skimming off any foam/fat from the surface regularly to keep the broth clear. 
                Remove the brisket when it is tender (after about 1-2 hours) and set aside. 
                When finished, strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve and season with fish sauce and sugar to taste. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Prepare Noodles and Meat:</strong>
                Cook the rice noodles according to package instructions, then drain. 
                Slice the brisket and the raw sirloin very thinly.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Assemble and Serve:</strong>
                Divide the noodles among serving bowls and top with cooked brisket and raw, thinly sliced steak. 
                Ladle the boiling hot broth directly over the beef, which will cook the raw meat instantly. 
                Serve immediately with the garnishes and sauces on the side. 
            </li>
        </ol>
